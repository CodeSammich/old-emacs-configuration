# My personal Emacs configuration #

My own home-grown Emacs configuration with
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

## Setup ‚Äî How do you use it? ##

You need Emacs 25 snapshot builds, straight from Git `master`.  Stable
releases of GNU Emacs won‚Äôt work, I¬†build GNU Emacs weekly.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/lunaryorn/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
$ brew install trash coreutils
$ brew install aspell --with-lang-de --with-lang-en
```

plus all the standard tools for all the various programming languages (`sbt`,
`hlint`, `stack`, `pandoc`, `pylint` and stuff).  Read the comments in `init.el`
for more information.

## Layout ‚Äî Where do you find things? ##

It‚Äôs¬†a single big `init.el`, containing only `use-package` declarations for all
the built-in and 3rd party packages I¬†use.  These declarations have all the
configuration and setup for the specific packages.

There‚Äôs¬†also `lisp/` which has my own personal extensions and libraries with
custom functions, etc.  These libraries are loaded like normal packages with
`use-package` in `init.el`.

## Highlights ‚Äî What you should probably copy from this! ##

- Very good OS X support, even with stock GNU Emacs, including a font setup that
  supports Math, Symbols and Coloured Emojis (yay üòç)
- A¬†well-designed key bindings scheme, greatly inspired by Spacemacs and
  supported by Which Key Mode
- Rules for buffer displays in `display-buffer-alist`
- A¬†very powerful and comprehensive LaTeX setup with AUCTeX
- Nice configurations for Scala, Emacs Lisp and a couple of other languages
