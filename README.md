**Note**: I‚Äôm currently experimenting with [Spacemacs][], a great and beautiful
Emacs distribution combining the power and flexibility of Emacs with the
convenient modal editing of Vim.  I‚Äôm already using it for my daily work and so
far I‚Äôm really enjoying it.  It‚Äôs very well-designed and very powerful, and I‚Äôm
slowly porting over bits and pieces of my configuration.  Chances are that I‚Äôm
going to retire this configuration soon.  Meanwhile, you may want to take a look
at my [Spacemacs configuration](https://github.com/lunaryorn/dotfiles/tree/master/spacemacs/.spacemacs.d).

My own home-grown Emacs configuration with
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

Setup ‚Äî How do you use it?
--------------------------

You need Emacs 25 snapshot builds, straight from Git `master`.  Stable
releases of GNU Emacs won‚Äôt work, I¬†build GNU Emacs weekly.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/lunaryorn/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
$ brew install trash coreutils
$ brew install aspell --with-lang-de --with-lang-en
```

plus all the standard tools for all the various programming languages (`sbt`,
`hlint`, `stack`, `pandoc`, `pylint` and stuff).  Read the comments in `init.el`
for more information.

Layout ‚Äî Where do you find things?
----------------------------------

It‚Äôs¬†a single big `init.el`, containing only `use-package` declarations for all
the built-in and 3rd party packages I¬†use.  These declarations have all the
configuration and setup for the specific packages.

There‚Äôs¬†also `lisp/` which has my own personal extensions and libraries with
custom functions, etc.  These libraries are loaded like normal packages with
`use-package` in `init.el`.

Highlights ‚Äî What you should probably copy from this!
-----------------------------------------------------

- Very good OS X support, even with stock GNU Emacs, including a font setup that
  supports Math, Symbols and Coloured Emojis (yay üòç)
- A¬†custom mode line setup
- A¬†well-designed key bindings scheme, greatly inspired by Spacemacs and
  supported by Which Key Mode
- Rules for buffer displays in `display-buffer-alist`
- A¬†very powerful and comprehensive LaTeX setup with AUCTeX
- Good configurations for Emacs Lisp, Scala and Haskell programming
