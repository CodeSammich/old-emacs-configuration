;;; Commentary:

;; String functions

;; `stante-string-trim' removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.

;; Load `stante-lib-autoloads' to use functions of this library.


;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun stante-string-trim (str)
  "Remove leading and trailing whitespace from STR."
  (while (string-match "\\`\n+\\|^\\s-+\\|\\s-+$\\|\n+\\'"
                       str)
    (setq str (replace-match "" t t str)))
  str)

(provide 'stante-lib-strings)
